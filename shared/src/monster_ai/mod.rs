//! Shared monster AI behavior tree runtime — used by both WASM (client) and native Rust (agent-client).
//!
//! The runtime is stateful per-monster via [`MonsterBrain`]. Each tick receives
//! external inputs (delta time, nearby players) and returns a list of
//! [`AiCommand`]s that the caller translates into network messages.
//!
//! The module is split into:
//! - [`tree`] — behavior tree data model and JSON loading
//! - [`command`] — AI state and behavior input/output types
//! - [`path`] — pathfinding abstraction ([`PathProvider`])
//! - [`brain`] — the per-monster [`MonsterBrain`] (struct, tick, event handlers)
//! - [`behavior`] — behavior tree execution (condition/action evaluation)
//! - [`movement`] — state transitions and path-following helpers
